The `NSM_Enhanced Variants` folder contains modified code that includes our modifications using BART, BERT and ELECTRA. It also includes
checkpoints to these models. Moreover, inside the main folder, it contains the question and answer dumps obtained from testing.
To do this dumps the code base also had to be modified in order to translate encoded words and entities.

Moreover, the folder `NSM_Vanilla Variant` contains the checkpoints and files from the baseline NSM model, together with q&a dumps. The code in the
repository was lightly modified too.
